# OSINT-Tracker

> This repository is part of the Ardens initiative. It will eventually host tools for tracking, organizing, and analyzing open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds with a focus on adversarial convergence and emerging threat patterns.

Status: Repository initialized as part of project roadmap. Full content coming soon.

Next-Generation Strategic OSINT Tracking: Note information does not equal intelligence. Without giving meaning to the data we collect, open-source findings are simply raw data. It is after this information is looked at from a critical thinking mindset and analyzed that it becomes intelligence.
